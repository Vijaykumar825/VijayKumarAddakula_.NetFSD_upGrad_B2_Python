         once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a wise old owl. The owl was known for its wisdom and often helped the other animals in the forest with their problems. One day, a young rabbit came to the owl with a question about how to find food during the winter. The owl advised the rabbit to gather and store food during the autumn months when it was abundant. The rabbit followed the owl's advice and was able to survive the harsh winter with plenty of food stored away. The moral of the story is that planning ahead and being prepared can help you overcome challenges in life.
